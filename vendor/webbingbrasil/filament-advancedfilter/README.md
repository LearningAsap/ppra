## Available Filters

### BooleanFilter

Filter records by boolean column:

In some cases you can have a `nullable` column, the BooleanFilter can handle nulls in different ways:

- Treats nulls as Unknown
- Treats nulls as True
- Treats nulls as False

by default `nulls` are treated as unknown and hidden

```php
BooleanFilter::make('is_active'')->nullsAreUnknown();
BooleanFilter::make('is_active'')->nullsAreTrue();
BooleanFilter::make('is_active'')->nullsAreFalse();
BooleanFilter::make('is_active'')->showUnknowns();
BooleanFilter::make('is_active'')->hideUnknowns();
```
